Edit the Makefile to suit your system.

Edit config.h as required.

If you want to use the supplied support scripts, as root:
Edit the sript and change any parameters to fit your system
(in particular properties.sh uses ls to obtain information about the file which may fail on some systems)

cp scripts/*.sh /usr/local/bin

Then:

make clean

make

make install

The last command will install an executable called rfm to /usr/local/bin by default.
